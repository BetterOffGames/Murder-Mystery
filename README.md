# murder-mystery

A multiplayer ARG where players take on the roles of murderers and innocents, murderers know which role every player has, but for every 2 innocents there is 1 murderer so they have to trick the innocent into killing each other. The innocent try to catch the murderers in the act or with incriminating evidence verbal or physical. When a someone dies the chat tells everyone the dead players name and their role, so a player who kills a murderer is more trust worthy to the innocent; which makes it a legitimate strategy to kill your fellow murderer.
